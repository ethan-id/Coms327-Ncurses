2/28
    7:32-7:40am
        Initialized repo, updated output to not display distance maps for hikers and rivals.
        Added some logic to handle --numtrainers, updated generateTerrain to take a parameter numTrainers.
    7:41am-8:21am
        Added generateTrainers() which is now creating an array of the trainers to be be generated
            Guarantees a hiker and rival if numTrainers > 2
    6:00pm-7:56pm
        generateTrainers() now adds all the npcs and player into a queue and removes them once to move them
    9:00pm-10:27pm
        commented out code in main() so that input is no longer handled for the time being
        added findPosition() to help give trainers positions
            added positionOccupied() as a helper function to the helper function
        TO-DO
            Handle moving trainers upon dequeue
            Handle reinserting trainers into queue based on time
            need to update displayMap() to display trainers where they belong
    10:27pm-10:47pm
        Updated displayMap() to display trainer positions without overwriting terrain array
        TO-DO
            Handle moving trainers upon dequeue
            Handle reinserting trainers into queue based on time

    2:36am-3:15am
        Got npc heap to start dequeueing things sort of correctly again, trying to figure out how to reinsert them after 'moving' them (for now just printing something) but not going quite so simply
    7:25am-11:00am
        Added getMoveCost() and starting to work on implementing the movement patterns of each trainer
        Fixed findPosition to now allow trainers to spawn on poke centers
        Started to reinsert trainers and players into queue for turns, code is looping as expected now.
    4:24pm-5:21pm
        added positionNotOccupied() to help check movement possibility for trainers
        Pacers movement implemented and working, working on wanderer.
    5:22pm-5:43pm
        Got a little stuck on bounding wanderers' movements properly, got the easy part of swimmers movements done instead.
            Swimmers dont path to the player yet but do swim around the water properly
    5:43pm-5:46pm
        Fixed wanderer movements
            simple mistake when verifying the position the wanderer was trying to move to was actually the right position.
                e.g trying to move to [rowPos - 1][colPos] but checking that [rowPos][colPos - 1] was possible.
    5:46pm-6:11pm
        Implemented explorer movements
        All trainer movement is now implemented excluding hiker, rival, and the part of swimmers that paths to the player
    6:11pm-7:51pm
        Finishing up README and changelog for submission
